# Swappable UICollectionView Items

Trying to use UICollectionView to swap items using part of the re-ordering functionality available. 

Timer allows a delay before the item is swapped with the current dragged cell. The cell can be moved around the grid without releasing it.

Although not perfect and could do with a refactor to tidy it up, shows a possible method to replicate an item swap capability.
